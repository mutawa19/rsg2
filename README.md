# random-sentence-generator

This project is my attempt at learning OOP in C++.
I will attach the PDF related to this project later on.

## How to contribute:
* Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/mutawa/random-sentence-generator`
* Set working directory to the repository
    `cd random-sentence-generator`
* Use your favorite text editor to modify the code, save
* Recompile
    `g++ *.cpp bin/rsg`
* Assuming no errors were produced by `g++`, you can check your modification by executing
    `bin/rsg poem.grammar`

## Note
The executable is stored in `bin` folder. All other files are C++ header or source code files, as well as Grammar files (with extension .grammar).
